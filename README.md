It is a **web portal** extension for Magento 2. 
It allows to implement a web portal on the Magento 2 platform.   

> A web portal a specially designed web site that brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way.

For now, I am developing this extension for myself only: I use it for my **[stripe.mage2.pro](https://stripe.mage2.pro)** website.  
So, the extension is not production ready for other use cases.  
If you want to use it for your own project, then I can implement the features you need, it will cost **from $900**.
